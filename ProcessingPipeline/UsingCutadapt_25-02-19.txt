-b adapter can be ligated to 3' or 5' end on forward read
-B as above but for reverse

-u/U LENGTH --cut=LENGTH Remove X bases from beginning (if +ve) or end (if -ve) of reads
--trim-n Trim Ns on ends of reads
--minimum-length Discard short reads
--max-n Discard reads with more than X bases. If number between 0 and 1 then intepreted as proportion
-q [5'cutoff,3'cutoff] --quality-cutoff=[5'cutoff,3'cutoff] Trim low-quality bases from 5' and/or 3' ends of each read

The -A/-G/-B/-U options work like their -a/-b/-g/-u counterparts, but
are applied to the second read in each pair.
-A ADAPTER          3' adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
-G ADAPTER          5' adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
-B ADAPTER          5'/3 adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.
-U LENGTH           Remove LENGTH bases from second read in a pair (see --cut).
